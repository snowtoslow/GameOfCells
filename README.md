GAME OF CELLS



1) Short description:

	Our goal was to turn on our imagination and make from a simple simulator something more 
	interesting :) . Our imagination was a little bit poor and we stole the ROLES and 	ENVIRONMENT from the coolest piece of art created in 21th century (aka GAME OF 	THRONES). Okay, after our small introduction lets go to the rules and roles of our game :)

2) Environments and Roles :
	
	As I said we stole ENVIRONMENTS and ROLES from mr. Martin (I hope he doesn't sue us for 	that :) );

    • ROLES :
          a) Stark family (aka StarkrGrey);
          b) Targarien family (aka TargarienRed);
          c) Lannister family (aka LannisterYellow) ;
          d) Free people( FreePeopleBlue) ;
	
    • ENVIRONMENTS :
          a) Winterfell (aka StarkrGrey) ;
          b) Lannisport (aka LannisterYellow) ;
          c)  Free people (aka FreePeopleBlue);  
          d)  Targarien family (aka TargarienRed);
          f)  Death zones (aka DeadZones);


3) Start games :

	1) Game starting:
		a) When we start our game of cells you have the possibility to chose firstly your role
		and also environment (or just environment or just roles)
		
		b) Firstly you need to select with arrow place where you want to draw your cells or 			environment. After you select the main place for cells or environment you need to prees
		“z” KEY and also with help of arrow keys drawing cells where you want(
		*тут небольшое уточнение насчет этого когда вы выбрали где хотите 				расположить клетки или зоны надо ЗАЖАТЬ кнопочку  “z”)
		
	2) The idea of environments :
		a) As I said we have 5 environments and the main idea is time of spawning of our cells;
		ex: If cells with roles like grey, yellow or blue is on red environment their spawn time is
	smaller but if they are on his own environment their spawn time is normal. 

	3)  Also I wanna mention that we’ve implemented something like a conquer of  enviroments.
     	    For example  if  cell color is same as enviroment our cell can’t die but it can be only 		 	    conquered by other color cells.


p.s: The main idea of why we implement cells coordinates from keyboard is because of big grid, and         when you try to place your cell the coordinates are not fixed.

p.s.s Sorry for late submission.
